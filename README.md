Weathervane
======

### About
Weathervane is a simple Sinatra app that takes the parameters of a GET request and displays them on a webpage.

It is one part of a larger [STEM lesson plan](https://github.com/jsimms/compost-instructions) around composting and computer science.

See also the [companion compost monitor sketch] (https://github.com/jsimms/compost_monitor), and [5 minute composting lesson](https://medium.com/@jdsimms/quick-composting-lesson-5ebdf1ad31c5).

### Thanks
Big thank you to Open Home Automation for putting up [a PHP version of this app] (https://github.com/openhomeautomation/wifi-weather-station). I simply rewrote it using Ruby and Sinatra.

### Contributing
Please feel free to improve Weathervane, or any other part of the lesson plan.

Here are a few things I'd like to eventually add to Weathervane.
* Be able to identify unique devices
* Store data into a database instead of creating txt files
* Create visual charts to show temperature and humidity over time
* Send email or SMS alerts when a pile is cold

But there are tons of other things as well.
